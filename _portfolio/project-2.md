This website was created using R's blogdown package, Github and Netlify. The site uses a [Hugo theme](https://github.com/onweru/hugo-swift-theme) created by [@weru](https://github.com/onweru).

There are many good tutorials on the web aLready that show how to use [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) to websites and blogs with R Markdown. Soon I'll type up my own notes from having built a few websites using this method and post them to the blog on this website.
