A WIP experimenting with R's [Flexdashboard package](https://pkgs.rstudio.com/flexdashboard). See also [RStudio Blog](https://blog.rstudio.com/2016/05/17/flexdashboard-easy-interactive-dashboards-for-r/).

Looking to use some [Vic Crime Stats](https://www.crimestatistics.vic.gov.au/) to play with and geo-code.
