In this tutorial we will be using **TAGS** to extract data from Twitter and build an archive of tweets for analysis. TAGS is a free Google Sheet template which lets you setup and run automated collection of search results from Twitter.

> To run this tutorial you will need to have Google and Twitter accounts.

## Step One: Set-up accounts for Google and Twitter.

Go to TAGS (http://tags.hawksey.info/), click on **Get TAGS**, and click on TAGS **v6.1**.

Currently TAGS isn’t a verified application so you need to give TAGS permissions to make some changes to your Google account. Continue by clicking on Advanced on the **This app isn’t verified** screen and following the instructions.

A new browser tab should open, click on **Make a copy**.

After your copy has been made open **TAGS > Setup Twitter Access** and follow the onscreen instructions  (when electing this option you’ll be promoted to authorize the script to run several services). *The good news is you only need to run the setup once.*

Click on **Continue** in the dialogue pop-up that opens, and then on **Allow** to enable
TAGS to operate within the spreadsheet.

Once your copy has been made open **TAGS > Setup Twitter Access**. You now need to connect your Twitter account to your new TAGS sheet.

**Success!** You're ready to go..


## Step Two: Collect some tweets

TAGS allows you to collect tweets by searching for *Account names* (@SOMEONE) or *hash-tag* (#SOMETHING). Remember that TAGS can only provide tweets from around about the past week. 

Enter your *query* for the type of tweets you'd like  to collect on the **Readme/Settings sheet**..

.. and hit **TAGS > Run Now!** 

Once it's done you can see how many tweets you collected under **Stats / Number of Tweets**.

TAGS saves the results to the **Archive sheet**. Download the archive as an Excel or csv file as a backup and/or to clean or play with the data.

To build a larger archive of tweets under TAGS select **Update archive every hour**.

If you're not happy with the results or would like to search for something else, simply wipe the sheet and start again.
